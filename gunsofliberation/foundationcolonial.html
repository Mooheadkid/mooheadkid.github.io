            <h1>The Foundation of the Colonial Government</h1>
            <p>
                In 792 GE, Porfirio Luca di Caspare, an admiral from the Grand Confederation of the Santo Clar√≠n, 
                sailed too far off the coast of the Reino de Lucio. Caught in a hurricane, 
                he was blown off course until he reached a mysterious island, where he met whole civilizations 
                with treasure as far as the eye could see. The king and queen of Lucio at the time, Isonzo and Lucia, 
                funded more expeditions to establish contact. What followed was the conquest of the island, 
                and the establishment of the Colonial Government.
