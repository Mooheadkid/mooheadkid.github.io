            <h1>System of Time Measurement</h1>
            <p>
                The timeline can be split into two eras: BD and GE. BD stands for Before Dissolution, and GE stands for Gran Ã‰poca (Grand Era).
                BD years work similarly to BCE in the real world, and GE is analogous to CE.
            </p>
            <p>
                The year 0 GE marks the end of the tyrannical Lyrian Empire, which ruled over much of the mainland for centuries.
                Thus, year 792 GE is the 793rd year after the dissolution of the Lyrian Empire.
