            <h1>The Great Gem Guardians</h1>
            <p>
                The main deities of Lazulus, the Gem Guardians were the custodians of the plane, beings who controlled 
                a particulat aspect of the plane. Below are the current and former Gem Guardians.
            </p>
            <h2>Current Gem Guardians:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>The Ruby Regal</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Ruby Regal was the Guardian of the People, 
                            guiding the nations in their direction and resolving disputes and conflicts.
                             As her fellow Gem Guardians succumbed to the multitude
                              of threats surrounding them, the Ruby Regal decided that 
                              she alone could not guide the nations through the mounting tribulations 
                              and thus ascended to be with her kin.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>The Emerald Earl</h3>
                    <ul>
                       <li>
                        The Emerald Earl was the Guardian of the Land, maintaining Lazulus' land masses and the life 
                        that survives on them. Disillusioned with the custodianship of the humanoid races
                         the Emerald Earl left to found the Golden Grove, leaving behind the ethereal 
                         Verdant Mist which guides all adventurers to that final paradise.

                        <li>
                            The Diamond Deacon was the Guardian of the Deep, 
                            holding back the Divine forces of the Abyss from terrorizing the nations of the Lazuli Plane. 
                            As the Divine forces encroached on the Lazuli Plane, 
                            the Diamond Deacon sacrificed herself to create the Barrier Zirconia, 
                            which protects the Lazuli Plane from the Realms United and/or the Faerun Collective.

                        <li>
                            The Sapphire Sovereign was the Guardian of the Sky, 
                            controlling the flow and speed of water and wind. 
                            The Sapphire Sovereign's abilities, while potent, 
                            also came with a huge cost leading to mysterious circumstances surrounding their death.

                    <h3>The Fifth Gem Guardian</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Not much is known about a supposed 5th Gem Guardian,
                             however rumors echo throughout Lazulus. 
                             Some say he was a tyrant who ruled the Cult of Fives with an iron fist, 
                             before he was banished by the other Gem Guardians. Others say he perished in battle against the Divine forces. 
                            Still others say he, with his own hands, slew the Sapphire Sovereign, and began the Ruin of Lazulus.
