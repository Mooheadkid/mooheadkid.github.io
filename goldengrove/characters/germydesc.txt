Germy Seaphul, a tall, strong man with a very shiny head and a bright smile, wasn't always devoted to 
                the cause of the Ruby Regal. What he remembers of the time before is very little. Yet to him, the loss 
                of knowledge was an important step in the journey towards helping those in need. So to Germy, it matters 
                little the cost.
                One day, Germy came across a travelling young man whose good deeds inspired him. Germy swore an oath to 
                help that young man achieve his goals, and hopefully on the way fix the world. That young man's name is Ashton Melodius.<br>
                Germy's travels with Ashton will bring him into conflict with his worst enemies. Who they are, remains to be seen.
