            <h1>Ja Y. Jonesey</h1>
            <p>
                Not much is known about the figure that calls himself Ja Y. Jonesey. He was a noble, but he was also a beggar,
                a taxman, as well as a soldier. He lived in the forest, but also the metropoli of the world. 
                He takes many forms. He knows many things. He is infalliable. <br>
                His faces many, Ja's mind constantly races. Each life is lived in his mind, 
                each memory bringing him closer to being the ultimate being. In time, every experience of life will be his, 
                every memory resting in his mind. In memories, there lie power, and in power, lies the key to salvation. <br>
            </p>
            <h3>
                Time and entropy wil catch up to Ja, as the powers at be fight against him. 
                Will he be strong enough to weather the storm, or will he succumb to the will of his enemies?
            </h3>
