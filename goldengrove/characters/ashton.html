            <h1>Ashton Melodius</h1>
            <p>
                Ashton Melodius was born to Linnaeus Melodius, 
                his father. He never knew his mother. Linnaeus lived as a hermetic druid, isolated in the mountains of Xin, and he raised his son to follow the same lifestyle. 
                Ashton learned everything he knew from his father - tending to their cattle, how to start a fire, identifying poisonous flora, and much more. 
                Linnaeus also taught his son how to attune to nature and channel the primal magics that govern it. 
                His father had an affinity for the fey and so too did Ashton, following in his footsteps.<br>
                When Ashton was young, he questioned the way that they lived. Alone, just the two of them, seemingly far away from much else than the mountain forest surrounding their home. He was not allowed to venture past a certain threshold of the woods. That rule was absolute. Linnaeus assured Ashton that they lived the way they did for their own good. 
                That the world beyond their little home was a dangerous place. 
                For a young boy, that was enough to stifle his curiosity. <br>
                He also asked about his mother. His father never shied away from the topic; Ashton knew from a young age that he had a mother, though he’d never met her. Linnaeus described her as “otherworldly”, saying that she held a beauty that one couldn’t easily look away from. He described Ashton’s mother as kind and caring, fierce when she was cross, and the absolute love of his life. However, in order for Ashton to grow up and have a life of his own, she had to leave him. Even to a young boy, it was clear that Linnaeus missed her. 
                Yet, he never described her leaving with any malice. He was happy to have a son to raise, even if it meant his beloved couldn’t stay with him. <br>
                As he grew older, the seed of doubt in Ashton’s mind blossomed into one of distrust. 
                He pressed his father for more details, only to be met with dismissal and dodgy answers. 
                The questions he held since adolescence could no longer be quashed by Linnaeus’ silver tongue. 
                Ashton wanted to know more about the world that lay past their woods, to know more about his mother, and to know why he and his father had to live such solitary lives. 
                For all his efforts, his father was as sturdy as an oak tree in refusing to give him any real answers. Approaching the age of 18, Ashton decided enough was enough. 
                If his father wouldn’t tell him anything, he’d seek out the answers himself. In the dead of night, as his father slept, Ashton slipped out of their cabin and travelled beyond the woods of his home for the first time. 
                He never said a word to his father and he never has since. <br>
                It took some time for him to adjust to life in civilization - in villages and towns and cities, each with their own set of customs and cultures. 
                The first settlement Ashton stumbled upon left him shocked at how many people could occupy a space together, to say nothing of the first time he visited a city. 
                One thing he quickly identified was that there were many people in need of help. When it was just him and his father, the problems Ashton faced were small, often repetitive, and reliably dealt with from his father’s expertise. 
                Here in the “outside” world, people’s problems were much more varied, and he only had his own skills to rely on. Still, Ashton put forth his druidic powers to help people however he could, whether it was something as small as a lost pet or as challenging as subduing a wild beast killing farmer’s cattle. 
                Thus, he began his tenure as a wandering druid, seeing the world and helping the people he met along the way. 
                An early adventuring life that would continue on for 8 years, bringing him to the present day. <br>
