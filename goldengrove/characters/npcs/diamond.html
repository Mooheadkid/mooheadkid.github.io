            <h1>The Diamond Deacon</h1>
            <h3>
                One of the four Great Gem Guardians, the Diamond Deacon's incorporeal form haunts the borders of the world, protecting 
                Lazulus from threats unseen. Her eternal eyes look outwards, beyond the places she is meant to protect. What a blessing it 
                is to protect something you love, yet what a curse it is to never be able to see it again.
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Diamond Deacon met the party at the border of the Epicenter. There, 
                she guided the party on the next steps towards opening the Golden Grove by imbuing her magic into the Guiding Amulet.
