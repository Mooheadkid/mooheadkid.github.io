                The mythical Fifth Gem Guardian, Onyx exhudes a calm, yet powerful aura. Confident, yet troubled, Onyx 
                hides much of what goes on in his mind. One can only presume what the Fifth Gem Guardian, polemic and

                He was first encountered by the party in a vision.
                He was then found by the party trapped in a crate held captive by Cesár: La Arma Verde. <br>
                After defeating Cesár, Onyx helped the party navigate the Verdant Mist, in exchange for helping him find his sword.
                He stayed with the party until the Diamond Deacon guided them towards the glyphs, leaving the Guiding Amulet with them.
