            <h1>Ellios Albertus "Albert" Casimir</h1>
            <p>
                Albert Casimir was the youngest of three brothers raised by Erasmus Casimir, a wandering 
                alchemist who discovered how to bind external magic into Kayden river clay. This 
                breakthrough allowed him to heal or enhance items without draining a caster’s personal power. 
                When Princess Selene of Kayd fell ill, Erasmus saved her life with a clay-bound 
                remedy—earning the title of Royal Alchemist. Soon after, the Crown Prince disappeared, and 
                suspicion fell on Erasmus. Though the king ordered only his death, Commander Sylas Marek 
                went further, executing Albert’s two older brothers as well. Albert fled with help from the Umbral
                Assembly, which revered his father’s research but viewed Albert merely as its successor. <br>
                
                Within the Assembly’s hidden enclaves, Albert refined his knowledge of alchemy but struggled 
                to shape magic without strong internal reserves. At sixteen, he parted ways and joined the 
                Ironbrand, a caste-based mercenary guild. There, he served as a field alchemist and medic, 
                crafting simple golems to pull wounded soldiers off the battlefield. It was under the tutelage of a 
                mute weretiger chef that Albert discovered a new approach: the same hands that kneaded
                dough and ground meat for cooking could also press and shape external energy into clay. By 
                mirroring the precision of culinary work, he learned to sense and guide magic in the same way 
                he felt heat, texture, and flavor—ultimately perfecting his clay golems. <br>
                When Albert realized the Ironbrand was arming the very monarchy that killed his family, he 
                sabotaged their operations and fled. Now, he lives in hiding, driven to complete the Casimir 
                Formula his father never finished. The monarchy believes him dead, the Ironbrand calls him a 
                traitor, and the Umbral Assembly waits for his return. But Albert remains focused on unraveling 
                his father’s legacy—proving, perhaps, that not all of Kayd is beyond redemption. <br>
            </p>
            <h3>
                As Albert uncovers the meaning of his father's work, the revelation of knowledge, once a comfortable embrace, 
                may become strangulation. When the truth of the Casimir Formula becomes revealed, will Albert's drive for knowledge
                become corrupted, or will Albert find the answer hidden amongst a sea of azure grass.
            </h3>
