            <h1>Three Planes in One</h1>
            <p>
                The plane known as Vivre is actually split into three planes of existance, bound together by the Realms United. 
                They are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Vivre: The Mortal Plane
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Mortal Plane, more commonly known as Vivre, is the home of all mortal creatures, 
                            Exalted or otherwise. Stuck between the two other planes, Vivre experiences much influence from
                            supernatural beings, to the chagrin of many Tarnished.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Pantheon
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Pantheon is the home of most Elders. Not much is known about this plane by mortals,
                             save for a couple mythical documents detailing a sunny paradise of sweet nectar. Mortals would never dare attempt
                             to set foot in The Pantheon. Yet when the Exalted leave the Mortal Plane behind, it is to The Pantheon that they go,
                             bound to serve the Elders in their home with joy.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Moritoria: The Dark Realm
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Moritoria is the realm of the damned. Souls who have disobeyed the decrees of the Elders are destined to be met 
                            with the fires of Moritoria. No mortal, Exalted or Tarnished, would dream of setting foot in this realm, save for
                            a few brave souls whose names have never been heard again. Legend tells of a secret path to enter Moritoria, a 
                            passage that no one with the right state of mind would dare try.
