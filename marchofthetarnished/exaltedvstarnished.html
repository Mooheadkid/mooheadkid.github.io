            <h1>Exalted vs. Tarnished</h1>
            <p>
                There exists a very simple difference between the Exalted of Vivre, and the Tarnished.<br>
                The Exalted and their ancestors have retained the favor of the Elders.<br>
                As for being Tarnished, there are two ways of becoming so. One is to inherit Tarnished status; the other is as 
                a punishment from the Elders. <br>
                In terms of differences between Exalted or Tarnished, it is said that the Elders can keenly sense 
                a person's Exalted Status, or lack there of.
